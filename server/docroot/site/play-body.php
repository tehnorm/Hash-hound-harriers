<h1>How It Works</h1>

<p>First, the Hare determines the trail ahead of time.  On the day of the race, the Hare leaves the group.  After walking/running 150 yards, the Hare hits the Checkpoint Marker button on his smartphone.  Then, he heads east, setting an Arrow Marker after 100 yards, and a FalsePoint Marker after 100 yards more.
</p>
<p>Then, he runs back to the initial checkpoint, heading north.  He places an Arrow Marker pointing north after 100 yards, then another Checkpoint after 100 yards more.  He will continue placing Markers in a similar fashion, trying to setup a trail that tricks the hounds.
</p>
<p>After 15 minutes, the Hounds leave the starting point.  They spread out in all directions, communicating between each other to know their status.  When a Hound reaches a Marker, the entire pack is notified (on their smartphone).
</p>
<p>In this way, they continue to discover the Markers, which tell them, as a group, which direction the Hare went.
</p>
<p>If the Hounds catch the Hare, they win.  If the Hare reaches his Endpoint, he waits happily as the Hounds come to the Endpoint.  After the race, everyone socializes to celebrate the event.
</p>

<!--<h1>History</h1>

<p>Hashing is a derivation of Hares and Hounds, also known as a Paper Chase.   Beginning in 1938 in Malaysia, 'Hash House' was the nickname of the British fraternity, and 'Harriers' was simply a name for groups who played Hares and Hounds.   
</p>
<p>The American classic style of a hash is called the Okinawa style, named after the American military base in Japan where the game was introduced to Americans.
</p>
<p>Organizations continue to exist that play this classic game.  Trails are set that are run, biked, hiked, sometimes including trips on public transportation.
</p>

<h1>Dead Hare vs Live Hare</h1>
<p>Dead Hare is a preset course, keeping the group together.  Live Hare is a more competitive, where the hare sets the course in live active.</p>

<h1>Setting the Trail</h1>

<p>The hare's number-one objective should be to CONTROL the pack through the use of judicious marking. The pack does not want to be controlled. Through malice or happenstance they will screw you up if they can. Keep the pack together by being mean to the FRBs and kind to the plodders at the back of the pack.
</p>

<p>A trail mark (permitted on true or false trails) consisting of a splash of flour, strip of paper, arrow, or other special or seasonal marking as designated by the hare at the start (and permitted by local hash tradition). Other media are used to usually poorer success or for special conditions such as snow, rain or night hashes (hash is discussed in detail later).
</p>
<p><b>Check</b>- (in a few hashes referred to as a Checkmark or Intersection) is chalked on pavement or other easily visible, hard surface such as a board, wall, etc., or drawn in flour on a rougher trail's surface. A check indicates that the trail divides at this point in at least two or more directions. There is no limit to the number of directions and the three H's simply stand for Hash House Harriers
</p>
<p><b>Arrow</b>- a hash mark that indicates trail direction (used on either true or false trail) and is chalked or drawn in flour on any surface easily seen from the trail. Variations allow you to thwart short cutting bastards (SCB's) on main thoroughfares.
</p>
<p><b>ON ON</b> or <b>Hare Arrow</b>- indicates true trail direction. It is a courtesy to put a hare arrow or draw ON ON within a hundred meters of a check, so that the lead runner can signal true trail, "ON-ON!", to the rest of the Pack. This courtesy is sometimes ignored by sole-hares (those who hare without the benefit of a co-hare) or by poor runners who need the additional advantage. Only the hares may draw a hare arrow or ON ON. It may be drawn anywhere on true trail, but, by definition, it may NOT be used on a false trail (BT).
</p>
<p><b>Bad Trail</b> (BT or Back Track) - marks the end of a false trail, defined as any misleading direction from a check with at least one hash mark. All such trails must end with this mark about 50-100 meters, but no more than 400 meters (or 1/4 mile), from a check. There can be NO check or other trail split on a Bad Trail. However, there may be several BT's from a check.
</p>
<p><b>Trail Split</b> (Two-Headed Snake)-usually used to divide Wimp trails from Hasher trails. (Never intended as a two way check- both directions must be true trail directions.) A Wimp (sometimes referred to as Chickens) trail is either a section of trail or additional trail to provide an easier and/or shorter route for poor-runners, injured hashers, etc. The Hasher (also called Bulls) trail is for the more hearty of the pack.
</p>
<p><b>Beer Near</b>- A beer near may be a pub or a refreshment stop manned by non-runners or hidden in nearby bushes. If you see this symbol and no beer or other beverage is apparent, look around for it under leaves, bushes, etc. All hashers must drink from this stop before proceeding. A line or splash of hash towards the stash is a good idea. If the stash is not within ten meters or so, the hare should put an arrow and/or distance to the stash. Note it is the abbreviation, whereas "Beer Near" spelled out (next) means "On In".
</p>
<p><b>ON IN</b>- This notifies the pack that the trail will soon finish (within less than 400 meters or 1/4 mile) and there are no more checks or trail splits. If obviously near the start and there are no further hash marks, it may mean return to the start. Hares are usually considered safe from capture after drawing this mark. It prevents SCB's and those who hang around the start or finish vehicle/pub from having an unfair advantage. Use either or both of the following, with an optional hare arrow indicating direction.
</p>
<p><b>YBF</b> – You've been Fucked. this means you've been following a false trail - or rather, "You've been fucked". You're more likely to see these after a nice, long extension of a false trail - often through swamp or shiggy. Go back to the last check and look for true trail.
Following the Trail:
In Live Hare, the hare leaves 15 minutes before the Pack.  A co-hare is often necessary to correctly set the trail.  
</p>
<p>When trail marks are found by the FRBs, they notify the pack, informing them of the discovery.
</p>
<p>At the check, FRBs indicate the direction they are heading so that others can spread out the search.
</p>
<p>There is no need to keep the trail to foot.  There are options for taxis, cars, public transport, bikes, etc.  
A Live Hare Scenario:
(Remember, the best trails take time to plan out.  Impromptu courses can be fun, but a little planning goes a long way.)
The hare and co-hare leave the pack in the American Tobacco Campus.  The starting point is the Mellow Mushroom, where they leave to set a check at the stairs (by a quick hit on their iPhone).  This will force people to investigate downstairs.  The co-hare will walk downstairs, quickly setting a Bad Trail mark by the start of the YMCA.  This will stop the pack, forcing a run down the stairs before continuing on.
</p>
<p>While the co-hare runs downstairs, the hare runs toward the parking lot, hopping the fence to place another Eagle-Turkey split point immediately past it.  As the hare heads up to the third floor, setting a small circle checkpoint for the turkeys, the co-hare pops upto the second floor via the southern stairs, setting a BN (Beer Near) checkpoint behind a large trunk.  The co-hare hides a 6-pack of beer behind a tire.

<p>Both the hare and co-hare past the obvious stop at Tylers, setting regular checks and arrows to lead them into the Crowe Building.  The hare heads immediately through to the Tobacco Road, while the co-hare proceeds setting a long Bad Trail, possibly multiple.  They could even end at the same point, where there's a large YBF (You've Been Fooled.)
</p>
<p>While the co-hare is (hopefully) setting a false trail for the pack, the hare is heading to Tobacco Road, setting a large radius check along the way.   If the hare is aggressive, they can set a few checks inbetween, or head directly there.  At this point, they may need to be careful about being seen by the pack.  However, they would set an ON-IN at some point, ending at the Tobacco Road.
</p>
<br /><br />
<h1>A Dead Hare Scenario</h1>
<p>The major difference between a Live and Dead Hare is that Dead Hares are set ahead of time, allowing for more complex trails.  A trail can be set by a single individual, and reused by different groups.  However, there is less urgency and less competition, as there is no Live Hare to catch.
